# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What BookClaw is

A Node.js/TypeScript writing-agent gateway. One process runs an Express + Socket.IO server on port `3847`, serves a single-file dashboard, exposes a REST + WebSocket API, and optionally bridges to Telegram/Discord. The agent autonomously executes "projects" (multi-step writing pipelines: planning → bible → production → revision → format → launch) by chaining AI calls and injecting skill content into each step's prompt.

**Primary deployment focus: this app is designed to run locally or over a trusted local-area network via Docker.** It is not built or hardened for exposure to the public internet. The bind defaults to `0.0.0.0` so the published Docker port is reachable across the LAN; the security perimeter (bearer auth, deny-by-default CORS, optional source-IP allowlist, tightened CSP — see [Conventions](#conventions-specific-to-this-repo) and `docs/SECURITY.md`) targets a single-user home-LAN threat model. For any internet-facing or untrusted-network deployment, front it with a reverse proxy enforcing TLS and authentication — design and review decisions should weigh against the local/LAN threat model, not a hostile-internet one.

There is **no unit-test suite** (the only automated test is a startup + auth **smoke test**, `tests/smoke-test.sh` — see [Testing](#testing)), no compile step in dev (TypeScript runs through `tsx`), and a **`commit_message` + `./push.sh`** workflow — per the parent `/home/paul/data/dev/CLAUDE.md`, Claude writes the commit message to a `commit_message` file in the repo root and does **not** `git commit`/`git push` directly; the maintainer runs `./push.sh` (which `git add .` + commits with that message + pushes, then deletes `commit_message`). The maintainer is the **sole contributor, so work happens directly on `main`** — no feature branches.

**Auto-deploy trigger:** touching the repo-root **`build_now`** file (then pushing) signals a watcher on the **Mercury** host to pull and run `scripts/deploy.sh` automatically — i.e. updating `build_now` kicks off a Docker rebuild + redeploy on Mercury, rather than running the deploy by hand inside the VM. Real-money smokes can then run from any LAN box against `http://192.168.1.32:3847` (see [Testing](#testing)).

## Feature tracking workflow

All features for this project are tracked in two files:

- **`docs/TODO.md`** — every pending feature, cleanup, investigation, and larger item. Anything currently being worked on must appear here.
- **`docs/COMPLETED.md`** — items moved out of `TODO.md` once finished, with a completion date.

Rules for Claude:

- **Every feature the user is working on must be in `docs/TODO.md`.** When the user describes new work that is not already listed, **prompt them to add it to the TODO before starting** — do not silently begin work on an untracked item.
- **On completion**, move the item from `docs/TODO.md` to `docs/COMPLETED.md`. Do not just check the box and leave it in `TODO.md`. Preserve the original bullet text, prepend a completion date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), and remove it from `TODO.md` in the same edit.
- Match the existing TODO grouping when adding new entries (e.g. "Quick cleanups", "Investigations", "Larger items"). If no group fits, create one rather than dumping into a misleading bucket.

## Karpathy AI Coding Guidelines

**These directives are MANDATORY and apply to every coding task, in every project, without exception.** They are not suggestions, defaults, or tie-breakers — they override conflicting habits, training defaults, and stylistic preferences. Follow all four at all times:

- Apply them to every response that writes, edits, reviews, or plans code — no matter how small the change.
- Do not skip, soften, or abbreviate them under time pressure, token pressure, or user urgency.
- If a user request appears to conflict with these directives, surface the conflict explicitly and ask before proceeding — do not silently deviate.
- Before submitting any code change, self-check against all four sections below. If any check fails, revise before responding.

### 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Build Order (before writing code)

Stop at the first rung that holds:
1. Does this need to exist? → no: skip it
2. Stdlib does it? → use it
3. Native platform feature? → use it
4. Installed dependency? → use it
5. One line? → one line
6. Only then: the minimum that works

Lazy, not negligent: trust-boundary validation, data-loss handling, security, and accessibility are never cut for simplicity. 

## Commands

```bash
npm start              # node --import tsx gateway/src/index.ts
npm run dev            # same, with --watch (file reload)
npx tsc --noEmit       # type-check only (no emit; nothing reads dist in dev)
npm run build          # tsc emit to dist/ — consumed by docker/Dockerfile stage-1 builder; production image runs `node dist/gateway/src/index.js`
npm run setup          # interactive setup wizard
npm run security-audit # runs scripts/security-check.js
npm run docker:up      # docker-compose up -d (uses docker/docker-compose.yml)
npm run test:smoke     # boot the gateway + assert auth is enforced (tests/smoke-test.sh; -v streams the server log)
```

No lint runner and no unit-test runner are configured. The scripted tests live in `tests/` (currently just the smoke test) — see [Testing](#testing). Don't invent other test commands.

Ad-hoc liveness checks (the smoke test already covers these as assertions):
```bash
curl http://localhost:3847/api/status        # liveness (401 unless auth disabled or a bearer token is sent)
curl http://localhost:3847/api/projects/list # project state
```

## Testing

**Tests must be scripted so they can be repeated.** Any check worth running is worth committing as a runnable script under `tests/`. When you verify behaviour by hand (curl sequences, startup checks, status-code assertions), capture it as a script before considering the work done — do not leave verification as one-off shell commands in a transcript that the next session can't re-run.

**Debug logging must be available for testing.** Tests and the code they exercise must expose a way to surface verbose/debug output so a failing run can be diagnosed without re-instrumenting the code — for example a `-v` flag on a test script that streams the captured server log, or a debug log level on the service under test.

Current scripted tests:

- `tests/smoke-test.sh` (`npm run test:smoke`) — boots the gateway and asserts the security perimeter across 4 phases (16 checks). **Auth:** `401` without a token, `200` with a valid bearer, `200` via the `?token=` query fallback, `401` on a wrong token, dashboard token injection, and the `BOOKCLAW_AUTH_DISABLED=1` escape hatch. **CORS:** cross-origin denied by default, and with `BOOKCLAW_CORS_ORIGINS` set a listed origin is echoed while an unlisted one is not. **Source-IP allowlist** (with `BOOKCLAW_TRUST_PROXY=1` so the client IP is driven via `X-Forwarded-For`): exact IP and CIDR members allowed, unlisted IP → `403` even with a valid token (the gate sits in front of auth), and loopback always allowed. Hermetic and non-destructive: supplies the token via env (no `.env` write), binds loopback only, and leaves no stray process. Run `tests/smoke-test.sh -v` to stream the server log.

## High-level architecture

### Entry point and wiring

`gateway/src/index.ts` is **the** entry point — a single ~2,650-line `BookClawGateway` class that owns every service instance and wires them together in a numbered init sequence (Phase 1: config → Phase 2: security → Phase 3: soul/memory → Phase 4: AI providers → Phase 5: research gate → Phase 6: skills → Phase 6b-k: ~30 feature services → finally start HTTP + Socket.IO). When adding a new service, follow the existing pattern: instantiate it in a Phase block, wire its dependencies via setter methods (not constructor injection), and pass it through to `createAPIRoutes()` if it needs HTTP endpoints.

REST routes live in `gateway/src/api/routes.ts` (~5,500 lines) — a single factory function that mounts everything onto an Express router (per-domain route modules live under `gateway/src/api/routes/`, e.g. `books.routes.ts`). The **UI is the v6 React studio** (book-container Phase 6) under `frontend/studio/` — an npm workspace, with shared code in `frontend/shared/` and the standalone **Chat app** in `frontend/chat/`. `npm run build:frontend` (Vite) builds the studio + chat dists; the studio's `index.html` is served statically at `/` (port 3847) with the `__BOOKCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN__` placeholder injected at request time, and the chat app is served on its own port (`BOOKCLAW_CHAT_PORT`, see `init/phase-12-chat-http.ts`). The Vite dists are **gitignored** — Docker builds them in the builder stage, and the build-then-assert unit tests (`studio-build`/`chat-build`) build them locally. The old vanilla-JS dashboard was **retired in the Phase 6i cutover**; only `dashboard/concept/` remains, as the design source-of-truth (plain HTML/CSS mockups, not wired to the app).

### Three concentric layers

1. **Security perimeter** (`gateway/src/security/`):
   - `Vault` — AES-256-GCM credential store at `config/.vault/vault.enc`. Master key from `BOOKCLAW_VAULT_KEY` env var; auto-generated into `.env` on first run if missing.
   - `SandboxGuard` — enforces that all file access stays under `workspace/`.
   - `InjectionDetector` — pattern-matches inbound user messages for prompt-injection attempts.
   - `AuditLog` — JSONL daily logs under `workspace/.audit/`.
   - `PermissionManager` — preset-based gating ("standard" by default).
   - `ConfirmationGateService` (services/) — universal approval gate for every Wave 3 irreversible action (publish, send, submit, upload, bid, purchase). 24h expiry. See `SECURITY.md` — do not bypass this for any new external-side-effect feature.

2. **AI routing** (`gateway/src/ai/router.ts`):
   - 6 providers: Ollama (free local), Gemini (free), DeepSeek (cheap), Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter.
   - Task types map to tiers (`free` / `mid` / `premium`) which map to ordered provider preference lists. `TASK_TIERS`, `TIER_ROUTING`, `TASK_REASONING`, and `TASK_OUTPUT_BUDGET` constants at the top of `router.ts` are the source of truth.
   - **Output budget matters**: tasks like `outline`, `book_bible`, `creative_writing` need 16K tokens — under-budgeting silently truncates output and breaks downstream pipeline steps. Don't lower these without understanding the failure mode they exist to prevent.
   - Reasoning effort (`thinking: low|medium|high`) gets translated per provider (Claude thinking budget, Gemini `thinkingConfig`, DeepSeek model swap to `deepseek-reasoner`, OpenAI `reasoning.effort`). Ignored silently on providers that don't support it.

3. **Skills + Projects** (the autonomous loop):
   - **Skills** are markdown files at `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`description`, `triggers`, `permissions`). Categories: `core`, `author`, `marketing`, `ops`, `toolkit` (lightweight "keep the writing mine" support roles that flag-don't-fix and never rewrite), `premium` (gitignored — purchased separately). `SkillLoader` parses frontmatter, stores full content, and matches by trigger-keyword substring. Synthetic skills can also be registered at runtime from discovered Author OS tools.
   - **ProjectEngine** (`services/projects.ts`, ~2,400 lines) owns 6 hardcoded project templates plus a `novel-pipeline` that chains all 6 phases. A "project" is a sequence of `ProjectStep`s, each with a `taskType` (routes to a tier), a `prompt`, an optional `skill` (whose content gets injected), and an optional `wordCountTarget` (triggers multi-pass continuation when the LLM runs out of room). When no template matches, the engine asks the AI to plan steps dynamically from the skill catalog.
   - Projects auto-execute on creation. Outputs land in `workspace/projects/<project-id>/`. Completion hooks fire `onProjectCompleted` callbacks — currently used for the website auto-add-book hook, user-model observation, and auto-skill drafting.

### Stateful directories

Everything user-generated lives under `workspace/` (entirely gitignored except the dir itself):
- `workspace/soul/` — SOUL.md, STYLE-GUIDE.md, VOICE-PROFILE.md (author identity, prompt-injected)
- `workspace/memory/` — conversation history, book bible, summaries, lessons, preferences
- `workspace/projects/<id>/` — project outputs (markdown per step + compiled DOCX/EPUB)
- `workspace/documents/` — uploaded large manuscripts (>15K words); excerpts get sent to AI, full text stays on disk
- `workspace/library/` — user template overlay (authors/genres/pipelines/sections/skills) read by `LibraryService`; overrides the built-in `library/` (baked at `/app/library`) by name, mirroring the skills overlay. The user **skills** overlay moved here from `workspace/skills/` (book-container Phase 1; one-time fail-soft boot migration in `init/phase-05`). Individual entries can be **shared/imported** as portable `.zip`s (book-container Phase 12): `LibraryTransferService` + `GET /api/library/:kind/:name/export` / `POST /api/library/import` (gated on injection findings), reusing the shared `transfer-security.ts` zip guards; imports land in this overlay (create-or-override by name), skills via the SkillLoader overlay path. See [docs/BOOK-CONTAINER-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/BOOK-CONTAINER-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `workspace/books/<slug>/` — per-book container created by `BookService` (book-container Phase 2): `book.json` manifest (`schemaVersion`-gated: too-old→quarantine, too-new→read-only) + `templates/` snapshot (author/genre/pipeline/sections copied from the library at create time) + `data/` outputs. Drives generation per-book: each project is **bound to a book at creation** (`Project.bookSlug`, book-container Phase 8) and its Author/Voice/Genre + output routing resolve from that binding (stateless `BookService.{authorDirOf,voiceDirOf,dataDirOf,genreGuideOf,pipelineOf}(slug)` + `SoulService.composeForBook()`), so multiple books run concurrently without cross-leak. Genre reaches prompts via `genreGuideOf` → `buildSystemPrompt` (Phase 7). Free chat still follows the single global active-book pointer (`workspace/.config/active-book.json`); per-channel chat selection is Phase 10.
- `workspace/.config/` — `personas.json`, `projects-state.json`, `channel-books.json` (per-channel active-book overrides, book-container Phase 10) (persistent state)
- `workspace/.activity/` — universal activity log (JSONL), surfaced to dashboard
- `workspace/.audit/` — security audit log (JSONL)
- `workspace/.agent/` — agent journal, self-improvement notes
- `workspace/.vault/` — see above
- `workspace/.bookclaw/workspace.json` — workspace schema marker (`schemaVersion`, `createdByApp`), stamped on first boot by `init/phase-01-config.ts` (`WORKSPACE_SCHEMA_VERSION`). On later boots the **workspace version gate** (`gateway/src/services/workspace-version.ts`, `classifyWorkspace`/`workspaceGate`) reads it and **fail-closed refuses to start** on an incompatible schema (too-new/too-old), overridable with `BOOKCLAW_SKIP_VERSION_GATE=1` — mirroring the per-book `classifyVersion`. Distinct from `version.ts` `BREAKING_VERSION` (API-display marker only). See [docs/BOOK-CONTAINER-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/BOOK-CONTAINER-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `workspace/audio/` — generated TTS files, auto-cleaned after 24h

**Backups live OUTSIDE the workspace** (book-container Phase 11, the release gate): `BackupService` (`gateway/src/services/backup.ts`) writes default-ON mirror snapshots to `BOOKCLAW_BACKUP_DIR` ?? config `backup.localPath` (default `~/bookclaw-backups`; in Docker a second host bind-mount `BOOKCLAW_BACKUP_PATH` → `/app/backups`), keep-last-10 pruned. Restore (whole-workspace or per-book via `/api/backups`) always pre-snapshots first and never touches `.vault`/`.audit`; a restored too-old book hits the `schemaVersion` gate. Cloud push is opt-in (directory-drop / `rclone:` / hook), **confirmation-gated when adding a destination**, and BookClaw never deletes remote data. Disabling backups logs a loud `⚠` (same posture pattern as auth).

In Docker, `workspace/` is a **host bind-mount** (`BOOKCLAW_WORKSPACE_PATH`, default `/home/paul/bookclaw-workspace`), not a named volume — so the working data is directly backup-able/shareable on the host (changed 2026-06-05; the encrypted vault is a separate volume, unaffected). `config/default.json` is the only versioned config; `config/user.json` overrides it and is gitignored.

### Bridges

`gateway/src/bridges/{telegram,discord}.ts` translate channel-specific commands (`/novel`, `/project`, `/write`, `/files`, `/read`, `/export`, `/speak`, `/voice`, etc.) into calls against the same internal handlers used by the dashboard chat. Conversation history is keyed by channel name to prevent cross-contamination between Telegram users, web chat, and API callers — preserve this when touching `conversationHistories` in `index.ts`.

### MCP server (`mcp/`)

`mcp/` is the **vendored BookClaw MCP server** (npm `bookclaw-mcp`, also a Claude Code plugin) — a thin, stateless TypeScript façade (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + express + zod) that exposes a curated subset of the gateway's REST API to MCP clients over Streamable HTTP (default) or stdio, plus a generic `bookclaw_request` escape hatch. It owns no state; BookClaw stays the source of truth. Its tool surface maps onto `gateway/src/api/routes/*.routes.ts`, so **the two change in lockstep — update `mcp/` tools in the same commit as the gateway route they wrap.** It has its own `package.json`/`tsconfig.json`/tests and `mcp/CLAUDE.md`; build/test with `cd mcp && npm install && npm run build && npm test`. It is published/installed as a package — consumers never clone the monorepo. (Vendored from the former standalone `bookclaw-mcp` repo, 2026-06-22.)

## Conventions specific to this repo

- **Imports use `.js` extensions** even though source is `.ts` — required by the `NodeNext` module resolution in `tsconfig.json`. Match this when adding files.
- **Node 22+** required (`engines` in `package.json`); `--import tsx` is how TS is loaded — don't switch to `ts-node`.
- **Server bind is configurable via `BOOKCLAW_BIND` env var, defaulting to `0.0.0.0`** (changed from hardcoded `127.0.0.1` so the published Docker port is reachable on the LAN). To restore the old behavior, set `BOOKCLAW_BIND=127.0.0.1`. (Helmet `connectSrc` was tightened to `'self'` on 2026-05-30 — the dashboard is same-origin only; `SECURITY.md`/README localhost-only language is stale — update when next touched.)
- **Security perimeter env vars** (from the security review — see `docs/COMPLETED.md`). Each is opt-out or opt-in via env; the constructor wires them and startup logs the posture:
  - `BOOKCLAW_AUTH_TOKEN` — bearer token gating `/api/*` + the Socket.IO handshake. Auto-generated into `.env` on first run; `BOOKCLAW_AUTH_DISABLED=1` turns auth off (loud warning). Native-element GETs use a `?token=` query fallback.
  - `BOOKCLAW_CORS_ORIGINS` — comma-separated browser-origin allowlist (Express + Socket.IO). **Unset = deny all cross-origin** (dashboard is same-origin, unaffected); a literal `*` restores permissive CORS (logged).
  - `BOOKCLAW_ALLOWED_IPS` — comma-separated source IPs/CIDRs gating *all* clients, in front of auth. **Unset = allow all** (notice logged); loopback always allowed. `BOOKCLAW_TRUST_PROXY=1` reads the client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` (only safe behind a sole-ingress proxy). **Docker caveat:** default bridge + published port masks source IPs — enforce at the host firewall / provider security group, or use host-net / a trusted proxy, for real per-IP control.
- **Errors during init are logged with `console.log('  ✓ …')` / `'  ⚠ …'` / `'  ℹ …'`** and the gateway continues with degraded capability when a service can't initialize (e.g. memory-search if `better-sqlite3` won't build, video-research if `yt-dlp` is missing). Preserve this fail-soft pattern — don't make startup require optional dependencies.
- **Premium skills are gitignored** (`skills/premium/*/`) — never commit them. The folder ships only with a `README.md`.
- **Workspace runtime data is gitignored** but the directory must exist; the gateway creates subdirs on init.
- **Workspace storage is a host bind-mount in Docker** (`BOOKCLAW_WORKSPACE_PATH`, default `/home/paul/bookclaw-workspace`; changed from a named volume 2026-06-05 — Phase 0 of [docs/BOOK-CONTAINER-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/BOOK-CONTAINER-ARCHITECTURE.md)). The container runs as the baked `bookclaw` user (uid 999) and Docker does **not** chown a host bind-mount, so `deploy.sh` aligns ownership after the build (`docker compose run --user 0 --entrypoint chown bookclaw -R bookclaw:bookclaw /app/workspace`) — a freshly created host dir would otherwise crash the app on its first write under `/app/workspace`. The `bookclaw-vault` volume stays a separate named volume.
- The parent `/home/paul/data/dev/CLAUDE.md` applies: surgical changes only, no speculative abstractions, ask before system-level changes, write commit messages to a `commit_message` file rather than committing directly.

## Things that look broken but aren't

- `OpenClaw` references in code and comments come from this being a fork of OpenClaw — they're not separate components. Two kinds appear: fork attribution (file headers, banner, `package.json` keyword) and "Inspired by OpenClaw …" credits on specific features (TTS, thinking-budget knobs, browser-doctor probe). Both are intentional.
