BookClaw is a security-hardened AI agent purpose-built for fiction and nonfiction authors. It doesn't just write — it runs the entire book production pipeline autonomously, from first idea to KDP-ready manuscript.

**Give it an idea and a pen name. It plans, writes, revises, formats, and launches.** Pipeline mode chains 6 production phases automatically. Author personas manage multiple pen names with distinct voices. Deep revision runs 21 editing passes. Export produces professional DOCX and EPUB ready for self-publishing.

Tell it what you want. It figures out the steps, picks the right skills, and executes.

> **"It's not just a writing tool. It's a writing partner, research assistant, editor, and marketing team rolled into one."**

---

## What Can It Do?

- **Pipeline** — Turn one idea + one pen name into a finished book across 6 automated phases
- **Write** — Draft scenes, chapters, and full manuscripts in your persona's voice
- **Revise** — 21-step deep revision: 3 passes (structural → scene-level → line-level) + AI beta readers
- **Plan** — 6 project templates: Book Planning, Book Bible, Book Production, Deep Revision, Format & Export, Book Launch
- **Personas** — Manage multiple pen names with distinct genres, voices, style markers, and bios
- **Research** — Deep dives into genres, markets, historical periods, craft techniques
- **Beta Read** — AI beta reader panel (romance super-reader, harsh critic, casual reader)
- **Market** — Blurbs, ad copy, Amazon descriptions, keywords, social media launch posts
- **Format** — KDP-ready DOCX (trim sizes, front/back matter) and valid EPUB3 export
- **Manage** — Track projects, pipelines, word counts across pen names
- **Listen** — Neural TTS voice engine with 9 author-optimized presets — hear your writing read aloud

---

## How It Works

1. **You say what you want** — via Telegram, dashboard, or API
2. **BookClaw plans the steps** — AI dynamically decomposes your task into executable steps
3. **Skills are auto-selected** — 19 focused writing skills get injected into each step's context
4. **Work happens autonomously** — each step runs through the AI, output saved to files
5. **Everything is logged** — universal activity feed tracks all agent actions in real-time

## Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3847` to access the web dashboard — a sidebar-driven interface with 5 panels:

- **Home** — Quick stats (words today, active projects, heartbeat status, personas), active project cards, full chat interface with slash command parity (all Telegram commands work in chat), today's writing progress bar, idle task count
- **Projects** — 7 template tiles (Book Planning, Book Bible, Book Production, Deep Revision, Format & Export, Book Launch, Full Novel Pipeline) + Custom AI-planned. Projects auto-execute on creation — no manual start needed. Project list with status filters, inline detail views with step progress, file downloads (MD + DOCX), and compile controls
- **Personas** — Author persona card grid with pen names, genres, style tags, and TTS voice. Create manually or generate with AI. Assign personas to projects for voice-consistent writing. Personas persist across updates with auto-backup
- **Library** — Document uploads and compiled manuscripts. Download DOCX and EPUB exports
- **Settings** — API keys (vault-encrypted), Telegram bot config, voice/TTS presets, research domain allowlist, autonomous heartbeat mode with configurable word goal, editable idle task queue (CRUD)

---

## Voice & Text-to-Speech

BookClaw includes a built-in neural voice engine powered by Microsoft Edge TTS — no API keys, no binary installation, no cost.

**9 author-optimized voice presets:**

| Preset | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| `narrator_female` | Most genres — clear, expressive (default) |
| `narrator_male` | Literary fiction, thrillers |
| `narrator_deep` | Epic fantasy, sci-fi, nonfiction |
| `narrator_warm` | Romance, memoir |
| `british_male` | Period pieces, cozy mysteries |
| `british_female` | Elegant literary fiction |
| `storyteller` | Adventure, YA |
| `snarky_nerd` | Witty banter, smart humor, sci-fi |
| `curious_kid` | Full of wonder, MG, picture books, whimsical |

**Telegram voice features:**
- `/speak Hello world` — Generate and send a voice message
- `/speak narrator_deep In a world...` — Use a specific voice
- `/speak 3` — Read file #3 from your last `/files` listing aloud
- `/voice on` — Toggle voice mode (all chat replies become voice + text)
- `/voice narrator_deep` — Set voice mode with a specific preset
- "Read that back" — Re-read the last response as voice

**API:** `POST /api/audio/generate` with `{ text, voice, rate, pitch, volume }`

> **⚠️ Audio files are automatically deleted after 24 hours.** If you generate a voice file you want to keep (e.g., a narration of your chapter), save or download it before the auto-cleanup runs. Use `/clean audio` to clear them manually, or find them in `workspace/audio/`.

---

## Document Library & Large Manuscript Support

BookClaw supports uploading manuscripts of any size — from short stories to 100K+ word novels.

**Two-tier upload system:**

| Upload Type | Size | How It Works |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Small files** (< 15K words) | Short stories, chapters, articles | Stored inline in project context — full text sent to AI |
| **Large files** (15K+ words) | Novels, full manuscripts | Auto-saved to `workspace/documents/` — smart excerpts sent to AI |

**How smart excerpts work for large manuscripts:**
- The first ~4,000 words (setup, voice, style) and last ~1,000 words (current state) are sent to the AI
- A truncation marker tells the AI the full document is available on disk
- This keeps AI context manageable while giving it enough to work with
- The full manuscript is always saved in `workspace/documents/` for reference

**Document Library API:**
- `GET /api/documents` — List all documents in the library
- `POST /api/documents/upload` — Upload directly to the library (up to 50MB)
- `DELETE /api/documents/:filename` — Remove a document

**Dashboard:** Upload files via the Projects tab (Upload button). Large files are automatically saved to both the project and the central library.

---

## Dynamic Task Planning

When you give BookClaw a task, it doesn't use hardcoded templates. Instead:

1. The AI receives a catalog of all available skills (with descriptions and triggers)
2. The AI receives the list of Author OS tools
3. The AI dynamically plans the right number of steps, picks the right skills (19 focused) for each
4. Each step is executed with that skill's full content injected into the AI's context
5. Results from earlier steps are chained into later steps for continuity

If AI planning fails, the system falls back to template-based planning (6 project types with pre-built step sequences). For pipeline mode, BookClaw chains all 6 phases (Planning → Bible → Production → Revision → Format → Launch) into a single automated workflow, passing outputs forward between phases.

---

## Skills

Skills are markdown files that teach the AI how to handle specific writing tasks. V4 ships with 19 focused, author-centric skills:

**Core Skills (4):** self-improve, after-action-review, prompt-optimizer, error-recovery

**Author Skills (13):** premise, outline, book-bible, write, revise, dialogue, style-clone, beta-reader, format, research, nonfiction-research, manuscript-hub, ingest-tool

**Marketing Skills (2):** blurb-writer, ad-copy

**Tool Ingestion:** BookClaw can read source code of any tool and generate a new skill from it. Just say "create a skill from this code" or use `POST /api/tools/ingest`.

Skills are automatically matched by keyword triggers and injected into the AI's context. A full reference with descriptions and example trigger keywords is available in `workspace/SKILLS.txt`.

## Security

BookClaw security features:

- **Vault**: AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage (scrypt KDF)
- **Sandbox**: Workspace-only file access enforcement
- **Audit**: Daily JSONL logs with categories (message, security, error, connection)
- **Injection Detection**: Pattern matching for prompt injection attempts
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-channel rate limits
- **Research Gate**: Real web search + HTML extraction, 50+ allowlisted domains, 60 req/hr rate limit
- **Configurable Bind**: Server bind address controlled by `BOOKCLAW_BIND` (default `0.0.0.0` for LAN reach; set to `127.0.0.1` for loopback-only). See the **Deployment — Defense in Depth** section below for the full fork posture.

---

## Deployment — Defense in Depth

> **We strongly recommend running BookClaw inside a VM or VPS with Docker.** Your API keys, manuscripts, and creative work deserve real protection. Defense in depth means multiple security layers — not just application-level security.

> **Fork posture — LAN-accessible by default.** This fork ships the Docker
> image bound to `0.0.0.0` so the published port is reachable from other hosts
> on the same LAN. The bind address is controlled by the `BOOKCLAW_BIND`
> env var (default `0.0.0.0`; set to `127.0.0.1` for loopback-only). This is
> intentional and overrides the upstream localhost-only behavior. **The
> service has no HTTP/WebSocket authentication.** Acceptable on a trusted
> single-user home LAN; not acceptable for wider exposure. For untrusted
> networks, front it with a reverse proxy (Caddy / Nginx / Traefik) that
> enforces auth and TLS. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#3-security-posture-of-the-local-installation) for the full posture.

### Recommended: VPS + Docker + VPN (Best Security)

This is the gold standard for always-on, secure operation:

1. **Rent a VPS** ($5-6/month) — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or Linode
2. **Install Docker** — containerizes BookClaw with strict resource limits
3. **Install Tailscale** — free mesh VPN, no public ports exposed
4. **Deploy BookClaw** — `docker compose up -d`

```bash
# On your VPS:
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
tailscale up

# Clone and deploy:
git clone https://github.com/Ckokoski/bookclaw.git
cd bookclaw/docker
docker compose up -d
```

**Why this matters:**
- VPS isolates BookClaw from your personal machine
- Docker containers limit file access and resource usage
- Tailscale VPN means zero public ports — only your devices can connect
- Telegram works 24/7 even when your computer is off
- Your manuscripts and API keys never leave the VPS

### Alternative: Local VM (Good Security)

If you prefer running locally:

1. **VirtualBox/UTM** — free VM software
2. **Ubuntu 24.04** — lightweight Linux inside the VM
3. **Run BookClaw natively** or with Docker inside the VM

```bash
# In your VM:
bash /media/sf_bookclaw-transfer/run.sh
```

**Why a VM helps:**
- Isolates BookClaw from your host OS
- If something goes wrong, the VM is disposable
- Shared folders let you copy files in/out safely
- Snapshots let you roll back to a known-good state

### Minimum: Local Development (Acceptable)

Running directly on your machine works fine for development and testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ckokoski/bookclaw.git
cd bookclaw && npm install
npx tsx gateway/src/index.ts
```

By default this fork binds BookClaw to `0.0.0.0:3847` so the Docker image is reachable on the LAN. For a pure-local dev box, set `BOOKCLAW_BIND=127.0.0.1` to restore loopback-only behavior. Either way, your API keys and manuscripts live on your main OS with no isolation layer.

### Security Layers Summary

| Layer | Local | VM | LAN Docker | VPS + Docker + VPN |
|-------|-------|-----|------------|--------------------|
| App-level vault (AES-256) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sandbox file access | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Audit logging | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OS isolation | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Container isolation | ❌ | Optional | ✅ | ✅ |
| Loopback-only network | Default | Default | ❌ (LAN-exposed) | ✅ (VPN-only) |
| HTTP/WS authentication | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ — add reverse proxy | ❌ — add reverse proxy |
| Always-on (Telegram 24/7) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Disposable environment | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

The "LAN Docker" column is this fork's default. The service has no built-in HTTP/WebSocket auth — if you're exposing beyond a trusted LAN, front it with an authenticating reverse proxy.

## Setup Wizard

For a guided setup experience, run the interactive wizard:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-wizard.sh
```

It walks you through everything: OS detection, Node.js installation, Ollama setup, API key configuration, vault passphrase creation, and personalization (genre, word goals). It even generates a troubleshooting prompt you can paste into any AI chatbot if you get stuck.
