# BookClaw

> **Notice — active development; wait for v5.** BookClaw is undergoing rapid, frequent changes right now. **Do not start a new novel on the current setup** — wait for the official **v5 release**, which will be the first stable baseline for new projects. Until then, expect breaking changes between commits (dashboard, pipelines, prompts/skills storage, config, and deploy scripts), and treat any in-progress work as disposable.

> **BookClaw is a fork of [AuthorClaw](https://github.com/Ckokoski/authorclaw) by Christopher Kokoski (Writing Secrets)** — with deep thanks for the foundation it builds on. AuthorClaw is itself a fork of OpenClaw. See [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements).

BookClaw is a security-hardened AI agent purpose-built for fiction and nonfiction authors. It doesn't just write — it runs the entire book production pipeline autonomously, from first idea to KDP-ready manuscript.

**Give it an idea and a pen name. It plans, writes, revises, formats, and launches.** Pipeline mode chains 6 production phases automatically. Author personas manage multiple pen names with distinct voices. Deep revision runs 21 editing passes. Export produces professional DOCX and EPUB ready for self-publishing.

Tell it what you want. It figures out the steps, picks the right skills, and executes.

> **"It's not just a writing tool. It's a writing partner, research assistant, editor, and marketing team rolled into one."**

---

## What Can It Do?

- **Pipeline** — Turn one idea + one pen name into a finished book across 6 automated phases
- **Write** — Draft scenes, chapters, and full manuscripts in your persona's voice
- **Revise** — 21-step deep revision: 3 passes (structural → scene-level → line-level) + AI beta readers
- **Plan** — 6 project templates: Book Planning, Book Bible, Book Production, Deep Revision, Format & Export, Book Launch
- **Personas** — Manage multiple pen names with distinct genres, voices, style markers, and bios
- **Research** — Deep dives into genres, markets, historical periods, craft techniques
- **Beta Read** — AI beta reader panel (romance super-reader, harsh critic, casual reader)
- **Market** — Blurbs, ad copy, Amazon descriptions, keywords, social media launch posts
- **Format** — KDP-ready DOCX (trim sizes, front/back matter) and valid EPUB3 export
- **Manage** — Track projects, pipelines, word counts across pen names
- **Listen** — Neural TTS voice engine with 9 author-optimized presets — hear your writing read aloud

---

## How It Works

1. **You say what you want** — via Telegram, dashboard, or API
2. **BookClaw plans the steps** — AI dynamically decomposes your task into executable steps
3. **Skills are auto-selected** — 19 focused writing skills get injected into each step's context
4. **Work happens autonomously** — each step runs through the AI, output saved to files
5. **Everything is logged** — universal activity feed tracks all agent actions in real-time

```

## Where BookClaw is heading

The rename from AuthorClaw is more than cosmetic. The name now centers the **book** — and that is the direction the project is steering toward: a **multi-author, multi-book studio**.

Today BookClaw runs one pipeline at a time around author personas. The North Star is many books in flight at once, each a first-class entity with its own author profile, genre, and customizable production pipeline — so a single instance can manage a whole catalog, not just one author's voice.

> **This is aspirational.** Not all of it is built yet. It is the lens used to weigh design decisions (storage shapes, API design, new features) — prefer the option that moves toward a multi-book model rather than re-cementing "the author" as a singleton. Track progress in [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/pshort05/bookclaw.git
cd bookclaw
npm install

# 2. Start BookClaw (auto-generates vault key on first run)
npx tsx gateway/src/index.ts

# 3. Open dashboard: http://localhost:3847
#    Settings (sidebar) → paste your Gemini API key → Save
#    (Free tier — the whole book costs $0)

# 4. Home → chat: "Write me a thriller about rogue AI" → Send
#    OR send /project to your Telegram bot
```

> **First run?** BookClaw auto-generates a vault encryption key and saves it to `.env`.
> Your API keys will persist across restarts. For a guided setup, run `bash scripts/setup-wizard.sh`.

See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for the full setup guide, or [docs/FIRST-NOVEL-GUIDE.md](docs/FIRST-NOVEL-GUIDE.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough of writing your first novel.

---

## Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3847` to access the web dashboard — a sidebar-driven interface with 6 panels:

- **Home** — Quick stats (words today, active projects, heartbeat status, personas), active project cards, full chat interface with slash command parity (all Telegram commands work in chat), today's writing progress bar, idle task count
- **Author HQ** — Single-page aggregate of everything in flight: today-at-a-glance stats, active projects, per-persona breakdown, and recent activity
- **Projects** — 7 template tiles (Book Planning, Book Bible, Book Production, Deep Revision, Format & Export, Book Launch, Full Novel Pipeline) + Custom AI-planned. Projects auto-execute on creation — no manual start needed. Project list with status filters, inline detail views with step progress, file downloads (MD + DOCX), and compile controls
- **Personas** — Author persona card grid with pen names, genres, style tags, and TTS voice. Create manually or generate with AI. Assign personas to projects for voice-consistent writing. Personas persist across updates with auto-backup
- **Library** — Document uploads and compiled manuscripts. Download DOCX and EPUB exports
- **Settings** — API keys (vault-encrypted), Telegram bot config, voice/TTS presets, research domain allowlist, autonomous heartbeat mode with configurable word goal, editable idle task queue (CRUD)

---

## Voice & Text-to-Speech

BookClaw includes a built-in neural voice engine powered by Microsoft Edge TTS — no API keys, no binary installation, no cost.

**9 author-optimized voice presets:**

| Preset | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| `narrator_female` | Most genres — clear, expressive (default) |
| `narrator_male` | Literary fiction, thrillers |
| `narrator_deep` | Epic fantasy, sci-fi, nonfiction |
| `narrator_warm` | Romance, memoir |
| `british_male` | Period pieces, cozy mysteries |
| `british_female` | Elegant literary fiction |
| `storyteller` | Adventure, YA |
| `snarky_nerd` | Witty banter, smart humor, sci-fi |
| `curious_kid` | Full of wonder, MG, picture books, whimsical |

**Telegram voice features:**
- `/speak Hello world` — Generate and send a voice message
- `/speak narrator_deep In a world...` — Use a specific voice
- `/speak 3` — Read file #3 from your last `/files` listing aloud
- `/voice on` — Toggle voice mode (all chat replies become voice + text)
- `/voice narrator_deep` — Set voice mode with a specific preset
- "Read that back" — Re-read the last response as voice

**API:** `POST /api/audio/generate` with `{ text, voice, rate, pitch, volume }`

> **⚠️ Audio files are automatically deleted after 24 hours.** If you generate a voice file you want to keep (e.g., a narration of your chapter), save or download it before the auto-cleanup runs. Use `/clean audio` to clear them manually, or find them in `workspace/audio/`.

---

## Document Library & Large Manuscript Support

BookClaw supports uploading manuscripts of any size — from short stories to 100K+ word novels.

**Two-tier upload system:**

| Upload Type | Size | How It Works |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Small files** (< 15K words) | Short stories, chapters, articles | Stored inline in project context — full text sent to AI |
| **Large files** (15K+ words) | Novels, full manuscripts | Auto-saved to `workspace/documents/` — smart excerpts sent to AI |

**How smart excerpts work for large manuscripts:**
- The first ~4,000 words (setup, voice, style) and last ~1,000 words (current state) are sent to the AI
- A truncation marker tells the AI the full document is available on disk
- This keeps AI context manageable while giving it enough to work with
- The full manuscript is always saved in `workspace/documents/` for reference

**Document Library API:**
- `GET /api/documents` — List all documents in the library
- `POST /api/documents/upload` — Upload directly to the library (up to 50MB)
- `DELETE /api/documents/:filename` — Remove a document

**Dashboard:** Upload files via the Projects tab (Upload button). Large files are automatically saved to both the project and the central library.

---

## Dynamic Task Planning

When you give BookClaw a task, it doesn't use hardcoded templates. Instead:

1. The AI receives a catalog of all available skills (with descriptions and triggers)
2. The AI receives the list of Author OS tools
3. The AI dynamically plans the right number of steps, picks the right skills (19 focused) for each
4. Each step is executed with that skill's full content injected into the AI's context
5. Results from earlier steps are chained into later steps for continuity

If AI planning fails, the system falls back to template-based planning (6 project types with pre-built step sequences). For pipeline mode, BookClaw chains all 6 phases (Planning → Bible → Production → Revision → Format → Launch) into a single automated workflow, passing outputs forward between phases.

---

## Skills

Skills are markdown files that teach the AI how to handle specific writing tasks. BookClaw ships with 29 focused, author-centric skills:

**Core Skills (6):** self-improve, after-action-review, prompt-optimizer, error-recovery, preference-learner, skill-acquisition

**Author Skills (15):** premise, outline, book-bible, write, revise, dialogue, style-clone, beta-reader, continuity-check, cover-designer, format, research, nonfiction-research, manuscript-hub, ingest-tool

**Marketing Skills (4):** blurb-writer, ad-copy, marketing-research, website-publisher

**Ops Skills (4):** task-planner, decision-maker, orchestrator-mgmt, browser-automation

Plus purchasable **premium** skills (gitignored; the folder ships with a README only).

**Tool Ingestion:** BookClaw can read source code of any tool and generate a new skill from it. Just say "create a skill from this code" or use `POST /api/tools/ingest`.

Skills are automatically matched by keyword triggers and injected into the AI's context. A full reference with descriptions and example trigger keywords is available in `workspace/SKILLS.txt`.

## Security

BookClaw ships a security perimeter tuned for a single-user home-LAN threat model:

- **Authentication**: bearer token gating every `/api/*` route and the Socket.IO handshake. Auto-generated into `.env` on first run; `BOOKCLAW_AUTH_DISABLED=1` turns it off (with a loud warning).
- **CORS**: cross-origin requests **denied by default**; allow specific browser origins via `BOOKCLAW_CORS_ORIGINS`.
- **Source-IP allowlist**: optional network gate (`BOOKCLAW_ALLOWED_IPS`, CIDRs supported) sitting in front of auth; loopback always allowed. `BOOKCLAW_TRUST_PROXY=1` reads the client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` behind a trusted proxy.
- **Content Security Policy**: Helmet CSP with `connect-src 'self'` (the dashboard is same-origin only).
- **Confirmation Gate**: every irreversible external action (publish, send, submit, upload, purchase) requires explicit user approval before it runs.
- **Vault**: AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage (scrypt KDF).
- **Sandbox**: Workspace-only file access enforcement.
- **Audit**: Daily JSONL logs with categories (message, security, error, connection).
- **Injection Detection**: Pattern matching for prompt injection attempts.
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-channel rate limits.
- **Research Gate**: Real web search + HTML extraction, 50+ allowlisted domains, 60 req/hr rate limit.
- **Configurable Bind**: Server bind address controlled by `BOOKCLAW_BIND` (default `0.0.0.0` for LAN reach; set to `127.0.0.1` for loopback-only). See the **Deployment — Defense in Depth** section below for the full fork posture.

---

## Deployment — Defense in Depth

> **We strongly recommend running BookClaw inside a VM or VPS with Docker.** Your API keys, manuscripts, and creative work deserve real protection. Defense in depth means multiple security layers — not just application-level security.

> **Fork posture — LAN-accessible by default, authenticated.** This fork ships the Docker
> image bound to `0.0.0.0` so the published port is reachable from other hosts
> on the same LAN. The bind address is controlled by the `BOOKCLAW_BIND`
> env var (default `0.0.0.0`; set to `127.0.0.1` for loopback-only). This is
> intentional and overrides the upstream localhost-only behavior. **A bearer
> token gates every `/api/*` route and the WebSocket handshake** (auto-generated
> on first run), CORS is deny-by-default, and an optional source-IP allowlist
> can gate connections in front of auth. This perimeter targets a trusted
> single-user home LAN — not a hostile internet. For untrusted networks, still
> front it with a reverse proxy (Caddy / Nginx / Traefik) that enforces TLS.
> See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#3-security-posture-of-the-local-installation) for the full posture.

### Recommended: VPS + Docker + VPN (Best Security)

This is the gold standard for always-on, secure operation:

1. **Rent a VPS** ($5-6/month) — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or Linode
2. **Install Docker** — containerizes BookClaw with strict resource limits
3. **Install Tailscale** — free mesh VPN, no public ports exposed
4. **Deploy BookClaw** — `docker compose up -d`

```bash
# On your VPS:
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
tailscale up

# Clone and deploy:
git clone https://github.com/pshort05/bookclaw.git
cd bookclaw/docker
docker compose up -d
```

**Why this matters:**
- VPS isolates BookClaw from your personal machine
- Docker containers limit file access and resource usage
- Tailscale VPN means zero public ports — only your devices can connect
- Telegram works 24/7 even when your computer is off
- Your manuscripts and API keys never leave the VPS

### Alternative: Local VM (Good Security)

If you prefer running locally:

1. **VirtualBox/UTM** — free VM software
2. **Ubuntu 24.04** — lightweight Linux inside the VM
3. **Run BookClaw natively** or with Docker inside the VM

```bash
# In your VM:
bash /media/sf_bookclaw-transfer/run.sh
```

**Why a VM helps:**
- Isolates BookClaw from your host OS
- If something goes wrong, the VM is disposable
- Shared folders let you copy files in/out safely
- Snapshots let you roll back to a known-good state

### Minimum: Local Development (Acceptable)

Running directly on your machine works fine for development and testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pshort05/bookclaw.git
cd bookclaw && npm install
npx tsx gateway/src/index.ts
```

By default this fork binds BookClaw to `0.0.0.0:3847` so the Docker image is reachable on the LAN. For a pure-local dev box, set `BOOKCLAW_BIND=127.0.0.1` to restore loopback-only behavior. Either way, your API keys and manuscripts live on your main OS with no isolation layer.

### Security Layers Summary

| Layer | Local | VM | LAN Docker | VPS + Docker + VPN |
|-------|-------|-----|------------|--------------------|

The "LAN Docker" column is this fork's default. The bearer token gates HTTP and WebSocket in every column; what's missing on the LAN is **TLS** — if you're exposing beyond a trusted LAN, front BookClaw with a reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS.

## Setup Wizard

For a guided setup experience, run the interactive wizard:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-wizard.sh
```

It walks you through everything: OS detection, Node.js installation, Ollama setup, API key configuration, vault passphrase creation, and personalization (genre, word goals). It even generates a troubleshooting prompt you can paste into any AI chatbot if you get stuck.

## Documentation

All supporting guides live in [`docs/`](docs/). Start with whichever matches what you need to do:

### 📘 Getting started
- **[docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)** — Install BookClaw and run your first task in under 5 minutes.
- **[docs/FIRST-NOVEL-GUIDE.md](docs/FIRST-NOVEL-GUIDE.md)** ✨ *new* — Step-by-step walkthrough from "I have an idea" to chapter files on disk. The how-to-use guide for the full novel pipeline (persona → planning → bible → production → revision → format → launch).

### 🛠 Operations
- **[docs/LAUNCH-GUIDE.md](docs/LAUNCH-GUIDE.md)** — Start, stop, monitor, and manage BookClaw across local, Docker, and VPS deployments. Ports, environment variables, common API calls.
- **[docs/TELEGRAM-SETUP.md](docs/TELEGRAM-SETUP.md)** ✨ *new* — End-to-end Telegram bot setup on Linux or macOS, with LAN access from other devices, firewall configuration, multi-user allowlists, and persistent service setup (systemd / launchd).
- **[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)** — Vault, sandbox, audit log, network posture, deployment guidance for trusted LAN vs untrusted exposure.

### 🗺 Roadmap & planning
- **[docs/OPENCLAW-UPDATES.md](docs/OPENCLAW-UPDATES.md)** ✨ *new* — Audit of OpenClaw upstream features (releases 2026.5.26 → 2026.5.27) that would benefit BookClaw, ranked by author-workflow value across 4 tiers, with a suggested sprint order.
- **[docs/STORYHACKERAI-PORTING.md](docs/STORYHACKERAI-PORTING.md)** ✨ *new* — Audit of StoryHackerAI (n8n-based author pipeline) for patterns to port. Top item: **make OpenRouter the canonical AI gateway** instead of one provider among five. Also covers the Selector → Brief → Draft → Check multi-pass chapter pattern, genre templates as reusable artifacts, and explicit Chronology / Style / Wordcount checks.
- **[docs/GOD-CLASS-REFACTOR.md](docs/GOD-CLASS-REFACTOR.md)** — Analysis of the former `index.ts` (2,649 lines) and `routes.ts` (5,516 lines, 234 endpoints in one function) god classes, and a three-level incremental refactor plan (phase extraction → service registry → plugin contracts). **Level 1 is complete** — init phases extracted into `gateway/src/init/` and the routes split into per-feature mounters under `gateway/src/api/routes/`; Levels 2–3 remain.
- **[docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md)** — Tracked work items: security review, quick cleanups, larger refactors, and standing constraints not to "fix."
- **[docs/RENAME-PLAN.md](docs/RENAME-PLAN.md)** — Historical record of the AuthorClaw → BookClaw rename (completed 2026-05-31): decisions, runbook, and verification.

## Acknowledgements

BookClaw is a fork of **[AuthorClaw](https://github.com/Ckokoski/authorclaw)** by **Christopher Kokoski (Writing Secrets)**. Enormous thanks to Christopher for building the foundation — the autonomous pipeline, author personas, skills system, and book-production workflow that BookClaw extends all originate in AuthorClaw.

AuthorClaw is itself a fork of **OpenClaw**, whose architecture and feature set (TTS engine, thinking-budget controls, browser-doctor probe, and more) this project continues to build on. Fork-attribution and "Inspired by OpenClaw …" credits remain throughout the code by design.

This project stands on both. Where BookClaw goes next — toward a multi-author, multi-book studio — is its own direction, but the starting point was their work.
